## Installation

### Requirements

* `pybind11`
* `scikit-build`
* `numpy`
* `scipy`
* `networkx`
* `pandas`
* `pytest`
* `basegraph`

### Installation with pip

You can use pip to install the python module:
```bash
pip install .
```
GraphInf is also available on PYPI:
```bash
pip install graphinf
```

Note that the `basegraph` must be installed. You can either download it and install it yourself, or you can load the submodules and install it directly from the repository:

```bash
git submodule --init
pip install ext/base_graph
```

### Build the C++ library

TO build the C++ library, we use cmake. First, we must set up the CMake environment. From the root directory (i.e., where the root file `CMakeFile.txt` is located), run the following command:

```bash
cmake -S . -B build 
```

This commands build the necessary scripts for building the library. To set up the environment for building the C++ unit tests as well, set the `BUILD_TEST` argument to `ON`:

```bash
cmake -S . -B build -DBUILD_TESTS=ON -Wno-dev
```

Finally, build the C++ library by running the following command:

```bash
cmake --build build -j4
```
